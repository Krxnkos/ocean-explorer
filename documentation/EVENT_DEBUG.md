# Ocean Explorer: Event Handling Debug Guide

If you're experiencing issues with the game not responding to clicks or key presses, this guide will help you diagnose and fix the problems.

## Click Not Continuing From Reward Screen

If clicking doesn't continue the game from the reward screen:

### Immediate Solutions:

1. **Use Keyboard Instead**: 
   - Press SPACE, ENTER, or ESC to continue from the reward screen
   - The game now supports multiple input methods for continuing

2. **Wait for Auto-Continue**:
   - The game will automatically continue after 5 seconds
   - You'll see the state change in the window title

3. **Multiple Input Methods**:
   - Try clicking repeatedly in different areas of the screen
   - Try both left and right mouse buttons
   - Try pressing keyboard keys while clicking

### Technical Troubleshooting:

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check Console Output**:
   - The game prints debug messages to the console
   - Look for messages like "Mouse click detected" or "Changing state"
   - If these messages appear but the game doesn't continue, there may be a state transition bug

2. **Check for OS Input Issues**:
   - Some systems have input filtering that can block rapid clicks
   - Try holding the mouse button down for a second
   - Make sure you're not in a modal dialog that's stealing focus

3. **Window Focus**:
   - Make sure the game window has focus when clicking
   - Click once on the title bar, then try clicking in the game again

## Event Queue Issues

If the game seems to ignore multiple inputs:

1. **Clean the Event Queue**:
   - Sometimes the event queue gets backed up
   - Press ESC to return to the EXPLORE state
   - Move around with arrow keys to reset game state

2. **Restart the Game**:
   - Close and reopen the game to reset all state
   - This clears any build-up in the event system

## Pygame-Specific Issues

Some Pygame-specific issues that might affect input:

1. **Window Not Responding**:
   - If the window shows "(Not Responding)" in the title, the game loop may be blocked
   - Close the game and check for any infinite loops in custom code

2. **Display Mode Compatibility**:
   - Some display modes can cause input issues
   - Try running the game in a window rather than fullscreen

3. **Input Device Conflicts**:
   - Disconnect extra input devices like game controllers
   - Try a different mouse if available

## Still Having Issues?

If you're still experiencing problems:

1. Try running the game as administrator
2. Update your graphics drivers and Python installation
3. Check that Pygame is properly installed with `pip show pygame`
4. Look for error messages in the console output

Remember: The window title will show the current game state. Use this to verify if your inputs are being registered correctly.
